## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Angular CLI version 16.1.0 or higher.
- A running backend server (if applicable).

### Installation

   git clone https://github.com/aGiBam/E-Commerce-Angular.git
   cd E-Commerce-Angular
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code Scaffolding

Use Angular CLI to generate components, directives, pipes, services, and more:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module
```

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
